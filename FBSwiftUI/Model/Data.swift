Pre-orders began on September 13, 2019, and was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13. The prominent changes compared with the iPhone XR are the Apple A13 Bionic chip, and an ultra wide dual camera system. While the iPhone 11 Pro comes with an 18W Lightning to USB-C fast charger, the iPhone 11 comes with the same 5W charger found on previous iPhones, even though this faster charger is compatible with both models."

A 17-inch version was sold from April 2006 to June 2012. The first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the PowerBook G4, but replaced PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Core 2 Duo processors and LED-backlit displays."

LTE-equipped models of the Series 3 and later can independently connect to a mobile network, substantially reducing the need for an iPhone after initial setup. Compatibility with the iPhone depends on the versions of the system software that each is running; as of February 2020, new Apple Watches come with watchOS 6 preinstalled, and require an iPhone running iOS 13. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015 and quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. In subsequent years, a new Series has been introduced each September."
